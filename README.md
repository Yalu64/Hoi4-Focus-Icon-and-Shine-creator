# Hoi4-Focus-Icon-and-Shine-creator

Simple script to fix existing icons and easily add new ones. The script can automatically create the goals.gfx and goals_shine.gfx SpriteType for the Icon.

The source code can be found in the src folder. Feel free to make edits to the script. Just leave credits under menu point 4.




## Installation & Usage

Installing the script:

```bash
  1. Download the .exe file from GitHub. 
```


```bash
  2. Move the executeable into the Modding Folder. 
```

```bash
  3. Make sure you already created the goals.gfx and goals_shine.gfx in the "interface" folder. 
```
```bash
  4. Prepare a folder where you will paste your icons. 
  This should be done in "gfx/interface/"YOUR FOLDER NAME" 
```
Using the script:

```bash
  1. Execute the EXE file by double clicking it. 
  
  If a Windows Defender notification pops up follow the step on the screenshot below.

```bash
  2. If the goals.gfx and goals_shine.gfx is not found automatically you will be asked to enter the route to the gfx files.
```

```bash
  3. Now enter the Folder name where your focus icons will be pasted in or/and are located.
```

```bash
  4. Use the script. More detailed explanation of the menu and what everything does can be found below.
```

## Features

- Auto Generate focus icons - When you paste new icons into the folder selected, they will be automatically added into goals.gfx and goals_shine.gfx. The name of the icon will be the name of the file. So rename your files before pasting them.
- Manually Generate focus icons - IMPORT ONE ICON AT A TIME! You will be asked, once you copied the icon into the folder what the name of the icon should be. Please note that the file name will not be changed, only the name of the icon. So adding 2 icons with the same name might break something (DUH)
- Web Gui - Not available might add soon might not. Check GitHub for new releases.
- Github - Just gives you a link to the github repo. 
- Check missing shine and gfx - Checks if one of your icons is missing a working shine or if you have gfx icons that are in the folder but not in the goals.gfx. You will be presented with 2 options, to add all icons automatically and to fix/add all shines automatically. Use this script to fix your old Johannes modding.
- Exit - Exits the app (Well that is quite obvious I hope)
